# Annotator
The explosion of new sequencing technologies has brought hope to sequence genomes efficiently. Many genomes are sequenced in record time and the limits of genomes or genes research are being pushed further and further. Annotator-RNAtor is a bioinformatics tool developed for the intra-genus study of bacterial homologous genes by comparing genes (Annotator) or gene expression (RNAtor). 
Annotator-RNAtor is written in python [1] with the user-friendliness of the PyQt5 GUI
